	Picking Strategies
		---note: we have a list of regions to choose from, but not every region is available to be picked
		---note: wastelands require at least 2 neutral regions in the super region, but are otherwise randomly placed
		---note: wastelands are determined after the picking phase but the amount is always 1/2 of #super regions

		-Focus
			Cluster/Defense -- stronghold, 				low mobility
			Vision  		-- map control, 			poor scaling
			Aggression  	-- game is decided quickly, high risk


		-Formation
			U  away 		--weak point
			âˆ©  towards 		--better distribution but lose vision
			o  donut/circle --inefficient travel
		
		-Technique
			Cluster/Defense -- Super region, continent
			Vision 			-- Spread thin, scout, sentry
			Aggression		-- Bottleneck, invade, one man army

		-Counter-Technique
			Cluster/Defense	-- Aggression -> Vision
			Vision 			-- Defense
			Aggression		-- Vision -> Defense

		---note: it will be hard to distinguish between aggression and vision in the picking phase
		---note: Edge crawler is another technique we talked about, but it seems more of a counter strategy than a strategy
